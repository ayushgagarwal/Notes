# Notes

While Googling is a great way to search for syntax/methods, having your own cheatsheet/notes always helps.

The files that I have uploaded are not meant to be referred as study material. While you can still go through them to get a jist of the commands that I have noted, it is meant to be used as a cheatsheet.

I use these documents to do a CTRL + F search in case I forget a particular command. 

I keep adding new commands in the files as I see them!

Files
- Data Cleaning using Python
- Common Numpy commands
- Common Pandas commands
- Common SQL commands and notes

The files in the RAW folder contain the ipynb/word files in case you want to make changes to the files.

Feel free to download and use them! :)
